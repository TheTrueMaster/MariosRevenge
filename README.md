# MariosRevenge
APCS Final Project


Welcome to Mario's Revenge (TM)!

Official site: shahindustries.one/mario.html


#How the code works#

Mario's Revenge follows an MVC design (Model View Controller) a design in which the classes are split up base 
on what they do. The Controller package handles our image map while out Model class handles the in game objects.
Now in View, we have the GUI classes, which handle the game mechanics as well as the visual representaion of the code.

To get a proper understanding of our code, you'll have to read the code itself. :D

#Which IDE should I use to look through it?#
Eclipse. Don't use Blu J, or the code will not work (Due to Blu J not supporting packages)
